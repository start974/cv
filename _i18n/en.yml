    I am a student in a master 2 of research in computer science.
    I am very interested in proof assistant (COQ) and program of proof (Why3).

    role: Software engineering internship, abstract interpretation
    details: |
      Development of
      <a href=http://www.mathworks.com/products/polyspace/index.html>Polyspace</a>,
      a static analysis tool developed and commercialized by
      <a heref=https://mathworks.com =>Mathworks</a>.
      It uses formal methods, more specifically abstract interpretation,
      to mathematically prove the absence of a large cathegory of
      runtime errors in C, C++ and Ada programs.
      Polyspace comes with several products including Code Prover,
      which aims to prove the absence of runtime errors
      and Bug Finder, which aims ft finding some bugs.
      The goal of this internship is to conceive and prototype a methodology
      to merge abstract interpretation and model checking techniques
      within the industrial static analyzer Polyspace.

    role: Research internship, function synthesis
    details: |
      CEA LIST develops <a href=http://frama-c.com>FRAMA-C</a>,
      a software platform facilitating the development of C
      program analysis tools (implemented in several plugins).
      One of the plugins provided by FRAMA-C is E-ACSL,
      it allows to do runtime assertion checking.
      The goal of the internship was to extend the class of expressible annotations of the
      E-ACSL to include logical functions and predicates.
      These functions and predicates are inductive or axiomatic relations,
      which express formal specifications that are not directly executable.
      In order to develop a tool for converting these
      functions to explicit functions(directly executable).

    role: Research internship, formal proof
    details: |
      Participation in the development of
      <a href=https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles>Hydra-Battles</a>,
      a documented and pedagogical Coq formalization project.
      I was supervised by Théo Zimmermann and Pierre Castéran.
      I contributed during this internship to the proofs of several theorems in Coq.
      And also contributed to use
      <a href =https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon>alectryon</a>
      a "litterate programming" tool, to automatize the import of Coq
      proofs in the documentation.
      Following my internship, a
