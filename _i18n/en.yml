    role: Formal proof research internship
    details: |
      Participation in the development of
      <a href=https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles>Hydra-Battles</a>,
      a documented and pedagogical Coq formalization project.
      I was supervised by Théo Zimmermann and Pierre Castéran.
      I contributed during this internship to the proofs of several theorems in Coq.
      And also contributed to use
      <a href =https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon>alectryon</a>
      a "litterate programming" tool, to automatize the import of Coq 
      proofs in the documentation.
      Following my internship, a 
      <a href=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03404668>papier</a>
      has been published at
